## Welcome to Norway’s National Access Point for transport data

This portal’s data catalogue gives you descriptions and links to data sets and services with information on road status, incidents, public transport, schedules and much more.

All data sets are open and available for re-use and as source for your own services.

All public and private organizations in Norway owning data sets or offering services related to road traffic, public transport and other mobility services, are obliged to publish information on these data sets and services through this portal. See detailed description on [publishing data]({{< ref "add-data.md" >}}).

All European countries are obliged to set up such a national access point to facilitate continuous information services for transport – in line with [the ITS Directive of the European Union]({{< ref "ITS.md" >}}).
