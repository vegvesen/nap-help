You will find the sets of available data in [the data catalogue of the portal]({{< napdict "fkkat_URL" >}}). The portal contains only metadata describing the actual data and how to find them. The data sources are as a rule located elsewhere, and the metadata therefore contains the links to access the transport data.â€ƒ

**Note:**

```
Dec 5, 19: Some people experience difficulties if they use Edge or Internet Explorer when they click on some data sets in the data catalogue. Until further noticed, please use another browser.
