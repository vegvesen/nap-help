      <description>The ITS Directive of the EU (2010/40/EU) instructs the EU member states- and Norway as part of the EEA agreement – to establish a National Access Point (NAP) to make open road and transport data available. The purpose is to achieve continuous and interoperable services in Europe.
The ITS Directive gives the EU Commission the authority to define delegated regulations with detailed specifications:
 Delegated regulation 885/2013 – Information services for safe and secure parking (no official service started in Norway yet) Delegated regulation 886/2013 – on the provision, where possible, of road safety-related minimum universal traffic information free of charge to users (SRTI) Delegated regulation 962/2015 - on the provision of EU-wide real-time traffic information services (RTTI) Delegated regulation 1926/2017 - on EU-wide multimodal travel information services (MMTI) (under legal implementation in Norway)   </description>

      <title>Where do I find the data?</title>

      <description>You will find the sets of available data in the data catalogue of the portal. The portal contains only metadata describing the actual data and how to find them. The data sources are as a rule located elsewhere, and the metadata therefore contains the links to access the transport data. </description>
